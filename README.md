Sample usage of ASP.NET CORE Signal R library. There is no need to install a separate package for the SignalR library that comes with Net Core. Before running the project, right-click the solution properties is selected, select the multi-application start process and click the apply button. My web and API project gets up and running. On the index page of my web project, it tries to connect to the hub, if the connection is successful, you will see the text connected. SignalR library is an exemplary project. Hope it will be useful for those who are interested.
